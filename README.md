# Musicalize data

This tool explores the use of sound as another dimension for interpreting data.

The aim of this experiment is to stimulate the use of hearing to engage with a dataset and reclaim, even symbolically, our ability to extract meaning from sound. The data contains air quality readings for the ACT and it is pulled directly from the API in real time. It is then processed and aggregated in monthly averages. There is one entry for each month back to June 2018 with the average parts per million concentration for 5 particles. Each particle is then assigned a different note and instrument which will play at a speed proportional to the particles concentration during a month. Each month corresponds to two seconds of sound. So if a sound doesn't appear for two seconds, or appears once or twice, that month's had a low concentration.

Acquiring information from this song is challenging, but I believe that our untrained brains are partly to blame. I hypothesize that with enough practice, meaning could be extracted just as effectively as through a plot. Meaning might not be in the form of neatly defined numbers and figures, but in a general sense of harmony disruption.

However, the primary goal of this exercise is not to provide a clear account of the ACT Air Quality, but to question the role of context in our preferences to approach data. I also hope to stimulate reflection on the lost art of listening mindfully, especially to the world around us. Ultimately, I wish to plant a seed in the listeners brain that germinates into a new way of engaging with the world, so the next time she goes for a walk, it is not only a visual spectacle but also a symphony sung by the world.
